    "The `FuncAnimation` class from the `matplotlib.animation` module is used to create animations by repeatedly calling a function (`update` in this case) at specified intervals. Here's a detailed breakdown of how it works in the context of the live chart:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Importing Required Libraries**: The necessary libraries for plotting and animation are imported, including `matplotlib.pyplot` and `FuncAnimation`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Setting Up the Plot**: A figure and axis are created using `plt.subplots()`. This is where the live data will be plotted.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Defining the Update Function**: The `update` function is defined to clear the axis and plot the latest data from the `tick_history` DataFrame. The x-axis labels are rotated for better readability, and the layout is adjusted to fit the plot elements properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Creating the Animation**: The `FuncAnimation` class is used to create the animation. It takes the figure, update function, and interval (in milliseconds) as arguments. In this case, the plot is updated every 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Displaying the Plot**: The `plt.show()` function is called to display the plot. This will open a window showing the live chart, which updates at the specified interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "To create and display a live chart using `FuncAnimation`, you would run the provided code. The chart will update every 5 seconds with the latest tick data, providing a real-time visualization of the bid prices."

    "\n",
    "1. **`stop_signal.set()`**: This line sets the `stop_signal` event. The `stop_signal` is a threading event that is used to signal the streaming thread to stop. When `stop_signal.set()` is called, the event is set to true, which the streaming thread checks in its loop to determine if it should exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`thread.join()`**: This line waits for the streaming thread to finish its execution. The `join` method blocks the calling thread (in this case, the main thread) until the thread whose `join` method is called is terminated. This ensures that the streaming thread has completely stopped before proceeding.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`print(\"Streaming stopped\")`**: This line simply prints a message to the console indicating that the streaming has been stopped. This is useful for debugging and confirming that the function has executed successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "To stop the live tick data streaming, you would call the `stop_streaming` function. This will set the stop signal, wait for the streaming thread to finish, and then print the confirmation message.\n"
